# Learn JavaScript

1. Basics of JavaScript

Topics: variables, data types, console, operators

Task 1: Print your name and age using console.log().

Task 2: Create two variables num1 and num2, and print their sum, difference, product, and quotient.

Task 3: Swap the values of two variables without using a third variable.



---

2. Conditional Statements (if/else, switch)

Task 4: Write a program to check if a number is even or odd.

Task 5: Ask the user for their marks and print grade:

A (>=90), B (>=75), C (>=50), F (<50).


Task 6: Use switch to build a simple day-of-week detector (input 1 → Monday).



---

3. Loops

Task 7: Print numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.

Task 8: Print the multiplication table of 5 using a while loop.

Task 9: Find the sum of numbers from 1 to N using a loop.



---

4. Functions

Task 10: Write a function isPrime(n) that checks if a number is prime.

Task 11: Create a function reverseString(str) that reverses a string.

Task 12: Write a function factorial(n) using recursion.



---

5. Arrays

Task 13: Print all elements of an array using a loop.

Task 14: Find the largest number in an array.

Task 15: Remove duplicates from an array.



---

6. Objects

Task 16: Create an object student with properties: name, age, marks. Print them.

Task 17: Write a function that takes a student object and prints "Pass" if marks >= 50, otherwise "Fail".

Task 18: Create an array of student objects and print the names of students who scored above 80.



---

7. DOM Manipulation

Task 19: Change the text of a <p> tag when a button is clicked.

Task 20: Create a counter with two buttons: Increment and Decrement.

Task 21: Build a simple to-do list app where tasks can be added dynamically.



---

8. Events

Task 22: Change the background color of the page when a button is clicked.

Task 23: Show an alert when the user presses a key.

Task 24: Validate a form (check if name is not empty and email contains “@”).



---

9. ES6+ Features

Task 25: Use template literals to print Hello, <name>! You are <age> years old.

Task 26: Use destructuring to extract values from an array/object.

Task 27: Use the spread operator to merge two arrays.



---

10. Asynchronous JS (setTimeout, Promises, async/await)

Task 28: Print "Hello" after 2 seconds using setTimeout().

Task 29: Create a promise that resolves after 3 seconds with "Data Loaded".

Task 30: Use async/await to fetch data from a public API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts).



---

11. Mini Projects

Task 31: Digital clock (updates every second).

Task 32: Number guessing game (computer picks a random number 1–100, user guesses).

Task 33: Simple calculator (add, subtract, multiply, divide).



---

👉 These tasks go from basic → intermediate → practical apps.
You can do live coding by first asking students to predict output, then typing and running the code.

Would you like me to make this into a ready-to-use teaching plan (day-wise lessons + tasks + expected outputs) so you can directly use it in your classes?
